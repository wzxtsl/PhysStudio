End-to-end checks render two video frames; Rhizomorph runs its complete 180-step
development trajectory. The Playground
rain showcase was also regenerated for its full 240 frames from the release
preset. The other showcase videos are the completed runs collected from the
original experiments. Sixteen core physics and rendering modules retain the
same Python syntax trees after import-path normalization and formatting. Five
LavaGS core modules also match their experiment versions after import-path
normalization. The packaged Calico demo uses the final 80-degree orbit.

Run the packaging check from the repository root:

```bash
python tools/check_release.py
```

The method READMEs list their numerical and GPU validation commands.

Thirteen Water + Sand solver, rendering, and validation modules match the
development version after import-path normalization and formatting. Shared
camera, video, and sampling helpers also match. Each of its three presets
completed a two-frame simulation, Gaussian render, and video audit at the full
128 × 84 × 75 simulation resolution. Same-state rendering was compared at
1280 × 800. The showcase contains the completed 180-frame trajectories.

Seven Plant Wilting core modules match the development version after import-path
normalization. The release workflow checks all three two-frame pipelines at
640 × 360, using the pinned public models and Newton installation. The Ficus
renderer reproduces five full-resolution showcase frames pixel for pixel.
The three plant showcase videos contain the complete reviewed trajectories.

Four StormGS core modules match the development version after import-path
normalization and formatting. Each of its three presets completed a two-frame
simulation, Gaussian render, and video audit. Nine frozen showcase keyframes
reproduce the development renders pixel for pixel at native resolution. The
three showcase videos contain 240 frames each. The wheel includes the StormGS
modules, scene calibrations, run guide, and reference metadata.

ThunderGS preserves the development solver and renderer after formatting.
All three presets regenerate their three discharges and complete a two-frame
Gaussian render, video audit, and gallery build. Nine full-resolution frozen
keyframes reproduce the development images pixel for pixel. The three released
videos contain 240 frames at 30 fps; the wheel includes all ThunderGS modules,
scene calibrations, run guide, and paper/asset references.

Capillary Contact keeps ten simulation and numerical-check modules byte-identical
to the accepted development version. Each exported preset completed a two-frame
simulation at the full 96 x 77 resolution, its numerical and trajectory checks,
a Cycles render, and video decoding. The complete showcase contains the accepted
180-frame orchard and 240-frame stirred cluster and paperclip trajectories.
All nine published MP4/GIF/JPG files match the approved originals; every GIF
frame and all three videos decode. Fresh Poly Haven downloads match the orchard
source assets. The wheel includes the solver, renderer, checks, run guide, and
paper/asset references.

Ice Melting keeps five core modules byte-identical to the development version;
its renderer matches after root-path normalization. All three presets completed
two-frame pipelines at the full particle resolution, including numerical checks,
mesh reconstruction, Cycles rendering, and video encoding. Cubes and arch run
without downloaded models. A fresh Bunny download matches its pinned SHA-256.
Two frozen Bunny frames were compared at 1280 x 800 with a maximum channel
difference of one 8-bit intensity level. The released videos match the three
approved 240-frame originals, including Bunny's updated wetting film; every GIF
frame decodes. The wheel includes the solver, renderer, checks, run guide, and
source metadata.

Fire-X GS preserves seven core physics and execution modules after import-path
normalization and formatting. All three presets completed two-frame pipelines
at their full simulation grid resolutions, including numerical checks, Gaussian
rendering, material and carbonization audits, and video/report generation.
Freshly prepared Playground and Bonsai material arrays match the development
assets exactly. Nine frozen frames reproduce the development images pixel for
pixel at 1280 x 800. The released videos match the accepted 420-frame Firewoods
and 450-frame Playground and Bonsai originals; every GIF frame decodes. The
wheel includes the modules, scene calibrations, run guide, CIE table, and
reference attribution.

Multi-fluid preserves the validated solver, scene, transport, surface, and
rendering implementation after portable imports and preset selection. All three
presets completed two-frame pipelines at their full particle resolution through
the shared launcher, including numerical checks, simulation audits, Cycles
rendering, and video decoding. Frozen tea and collision frames agree with the
development renders within one 8-bit channel level at 1280 x 800. The three
showcase MP4s match the approved files; every GIF frame decodes. The wheel
includes all modules, the control preset, run guide, and paper references.

Ice Solidification preserves twelve core modules after portable import and
root-path normalization. All three presets completed two-frame pipelines at
their full particle resolutions through the shared launcher, including heat
and contact audits, surface reconstruction, Cycles rendering, and MP4 decoding.
The packaged latent-heat, closed-exchange, isothermal, and Stefan-front checks
pass. Six frozen-state frames reproduce the reviewed images within one 8-bit
channel level at 1280 x 800. The three MP4s match the accepted originals;
every GIF frame decodes. The wheel includes all modules, cooling presets,
run guide, and paper references.

Rhizomorph preserves the development solver, presets, and checks after formatting.
All three presets completed 180 growth steps through the shared launcher,
including resource/trajectory audits, two-frame Cycles renders, and video decoding.
Transport checks pass for equilibrium, water/nutrient conservation, sealed cells,
and nonnegativity; all 256 paired root tips respond to the reversed nutrient
field. Three frozen frames reproduce the development images within one 8-bit
channel level at 960 x 1080. The released MP4s match the accepted 240-frame
originals, every GIF frame decodes, and the wheel includes the modules, run guide,
method notes, reference metadata, and attribution.
